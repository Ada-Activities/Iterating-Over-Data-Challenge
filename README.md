## Instructions
All group members should fork and clone this repository. After setting up your virtual environment and downloading `pytest` (see instructions above) as a group you should: 
- Look at the provided function stub
- Look at the provided tests
- Implement the functions to make the tests pass
- The first 3 functions build on each other.
    - Consider using each previous function to help build the next!
- The 4th function is there for whimsy, but it can still be tricky!

The first is done in class together.
